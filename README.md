# Multi-Choice-Quiz-Game

The High Score screen doesnt really work.
I just need to figure out how to pull the names/score from local storafge and append into a list.

But I am very tired and out of time, so if i have time later in the course ill try to get that working.


The entire thing also looks like garbage since i dont have time to add .css 

But for the most part it works, so thats nice.

I shall go to bed now, thanks
